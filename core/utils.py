        Tells if this ray hits anything in the scene, and if yes, gives the details of the closest hit


        world contains all the sphere objects inside it

        that .hit() function checks and tries to find the nearest intersection of the ray with any sphere
        simple quadratic equation, solves for discriminant
        the closest intersection is chosesn
        if an intersection exists it fills hit_record with that object's point normal color etc
        if nothing, then returns false, and we do some sky color grading then

        btw, t_min helps to avoid self intersection, just in case the ray start exactly on a surface
        float('inf') weird syntax, but it means the ray can go as far as it ones

        after this if statement we can safely use hit_record's p, normal and color
        we get the point where the ray is hit, and the surface normal (pointing outward)
        for diffusive shading, we are using random unit vector (uniformly distributed)

        what it does:
        start at the hit point
        nudge in the direction ofo the surface normal
        add some randomness so the bounce is not deterministic

        HENCE! the new ray is scatter in a random direction within the hemisphere above the surface to SIMULATE DIFFUSE REFLECTION!

        we add some "tint" color of the surface which we had hit
        so if the sphere is red, the scattered light inherits that "redness"
